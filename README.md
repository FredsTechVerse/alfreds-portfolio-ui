# REMAINING

- Confirm backdrop blur to navbar.
- Add social media tabs and respective icons even to close/open nav.
- Add astro animations to lighten the spirit.
- Prepare gifs for the projects.
- Add my social media handles.
- A GIF is better than slider of images - control over what client see in a whisk.
- A video overlay of project should come up on gif click.... Animations not necessary.
